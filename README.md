Project on AAU, glass vial inspection in OpenCV.

The folder VialsForProject has the different vials used in the project, as of now (2020-03-18) the pictures working best is DarkRoomVial and DarkRoomCrack. 

The folder VialProcessingV3 has all the files needed for running in Visual Studio, inside this folder is the Source.cpp with the code in it.

The OpenCVDebug is the x64 debugger used in the project (needed for OpenCV to function), some paths needs to be installed for it to be used.
